### Hi there, I'm Aleksandra ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior front end developer currently based in Georgia. For the last couple of years I've been leading a digital nomad lifestyle, which was my dream since childhood. Moving around taught me how to work effectively with different time zones and adapt quickly to changing circumstance. I'm open for new collaborations and I'll be happy to be part of an interesting project.
